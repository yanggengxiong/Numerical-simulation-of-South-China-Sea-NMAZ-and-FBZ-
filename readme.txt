This repository used in the study: 
Crustal heterogeneity controls the along-strike segmentation: Analog and numerical models of the northern South China Sea
Gengxiong Yang, Hongwei Yin*, Christian Schiffer, Sascha Brune, Dong Jia, Wei Wang 


The folder primarily contains the two experiments controlled by two factors.
The parameter files are named MAZ.prm and FBZ.prm:
MAZ: Magma Arc Zone
FBZ: Forearc Basin Zone

In MAZ.prm, the use of Diabase represents the Magma Arc, 
simulating the extensional process of the northern South China Sea margin under the influence of a magmatic arc.

In FBZ.prm, the pre-existing sedimentary layers increase the thickness of the brittle layer while maintaining a thinner ductile layer, 
simulating the extensional process of the northern South China Sea margin influenced by the Forearc Basin.


Model runs in the study used dealii 9.3.3.
The ASPECT version is 2.4.0-pre (main, 6496f3176)
